#### Dynamic Typing -->> when in python create a variable(no data-ype declaration) that why it is dynamic typing..
#example: name = "subha"
#age=18

### one variable will be string , int, float. boolea.....
#example: name as a  string , int, float. boolea.
#This is called dynamic binding == multiple data type store in one variable.
name="subhajit"
print(name)

name=1.3
print(name)


name=18
print(name)

name=True
print(name)




Age=18
print(Age)

follow=True
print(follow)



#static typing -->> must be declare data type. in other language-->>
#but in this case age only will be interger no change
#This is called static binding == only one data type store in one variable.
#Ex: int age=18;
#num only will be float no change
#float num=2.3;


#that maens suppose i ask what is your age? i store in name variable but work 
#this is not incorrect i consider a=input("what is your age")// but always a meaning full variable: 
#name=input("what is your age")/// this thing thats why use meaning full variable
#This is maening full variable:
age=input("what is your age")

#variable name : 
# A-Z, a-z , 0-9 and under score(_):
#Example:  
# name1, name123, name_1,a, a1, a_1 :

#But no sepcial symbol  not allow and sapce is also not allow
#Example : 
# name 1., name#1, name?// not allow

#variable name cannot start digit .
#  Example: 1_name.//flase
#  Example: 4name.//flase

#variable name alawys start in letter. 
# Example: name_1.//true
#Example: _name//true


#multi word name.
# Example:
#  
# camal case:
#  in case 1st sentence(my) is small and --> then the word only 1st word is uppercase(Name):
# EX: 1.myName 2. myVariableName

#pascal case:
#in case each word is strat in capital letter:
# 1. MyName 2. MyVariableName

#snake  case:
#separate in under score:
# 1.my_name 2. my_variable_name
